Hi.

I'm Dor Kleiman, AKA `the configurator`. I used to be a software engineer for just over a decade before I decided to call it quits and open a restaurant. This blog is where I plan to ramble on about boring things, and sometimes other stuff.

### Software

As a software engineer, I spent most of my years writing bespoke software in companies like [Softwire](http://www.softwire.com) and others which will mostly remain nameless, mainly because they impacted my life far less. For the last few years, I was a tech lead in a number of companies, where I was the guy in charge of the gory technical details.

I was quite good at it.

### Food

I was generally unhappy in the thankless jobs that the software world so often creates, and when my best friend, Chef Ofer Ben Or, and another friend, Aviad Yitzhaki, were about to open a restaurant, I decided to join them.

Owning a restaurant is lots of hard work, but it is extremely rewarding. With every happy customer I feel I have impacted the world more than I did in years of writing insurance simulators and intranet sites.

### Bayern

Our restaurant, [Bayern](http://www.bayern.org.il), is a German restaurant in Tel Aviv. We make authentic German food, like schnitzels, wursts, gulash and spatzle, and our food is generally very good.
